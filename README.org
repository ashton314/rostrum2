#+TITLE: Rostrum 2
#+SUBTITLE: Worship service program generator and manager

A web application to manage the creation and publication of programs for religious services, like those of the weekly Sunday services held by the [[https://churchofjesuschrist.org][Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

* Up and running

This project is built using the [[https://phoenixframework.org/][Phoenix web framework]] built on top of [[https://elixir-lang.org][Elixir]].

 - Install dependencies with ~mix deps.get~
 - Start up db with ~mix docker.db start~
 - Create database with ~mix ecto.setup~
 - Start Phoenix as server with ~mix phx.server~ or inside an IEx shell with ~iex -S mix phx.server~

* Goals

 - Web-first: I'll be skipping the PDF generation and focusing on having a nice, easy-to-read web version.
 - Flexible: I won't take too much structure into it this time.
 - Multi-account: we'll bake accounts into the project from the beginning.
